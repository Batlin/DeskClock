Based on latest AOSP Clock app (b89bbe70df hash) which keeps getting 
updates from Google, I've built it and added the following features:

- Automatic power on feature(*). You can turn off your device, 
go to sleep and... two minutes before the alarm you scheduled is 
triggered, your device will turn on automatically!

- Darker Theme (more comfortable for your eyes!)

And more features to come!

Source code on AOSP (that we have extended):

https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/DeskClock.git

* Note: this only works on Qualcomm devices based on CAF. If your device 
doesn't support this feature, a prompt will be shown when opening the app.

Technical explanation:

Qualcomm based devices (CAF) contain an AlarmManager class which defines 
a hidden alarm time (not exposed through API), 
called RTC_POWEROFF_WAKEUP described as follows:

Alarm time in {@link System#currentTimeMillis System.currentTimeMillis()}
(wall clock time in UTC), which will wake up the device when
it goes off. And it will power on the devices when it shuts down.
Set as 5 to make it be compatible with android_alarm_type.

Therefore, you can schedule alarms using this alarm type to power on 
the DUT at the schedule time you specified.

You should check if the framework your app is running on has this 
feature or not using reflection.

Lots of ideas are waiting to be implemented using this feature!

Waiting for your feedback!
